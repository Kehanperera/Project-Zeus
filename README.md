# Project-Zeus
Just a small project I did for fun.
I made ths project out of boredom, it uses the pyttsx3 text-to-speech conversion library in Python and the wikipedia library.
Currently there are only two options, but will be adding more in the future, I got this idea from the project zeus weapon system from the G.I Joe movie.
The only libraries needed to be installed are pyttsx3 (pip install pyttsx3) and the wikipedia library (pip install wikipedia), all other libraries imported in kehan.py 
and main.py are built in.
